# Udacity-build-a-portfolio-site
Another project in [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program called "Build a Portfolio Site".

## Description
Provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file, we replicate that design in HTML and CSS. A responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Contents
One of the longest sections in the course 

* Sizing Elements and the Box Model
* Intro to HTML and CSS
* Responsive Web Fundamentals
* Responsive Images
* Project

## Solution & Add On's

Use the course material and other Front-End Web Resources to best try and recreate the mock-up with a few custom design aspects of my own.
Implemented a custom Modal on the cards , that displays a high quality image depending on the device used to view the website.
Design inspired by Google Material Design.
